# multinational-retail-data-centralisation45

## Description:
This a project based on the mutinationational-retail-data-centralisations which is focused on
working using different coding skills based on dataextracting store_details with api request, aws s3,
panda cleaning methods and other technique. 

Once we have a clean panda dataframe from the extracted are placed within the sales_date database server as
a dim_table and order_table, it is then processed within the postgresql or sqltools on VScode by chaninging or altering datatype (e.g. adding primary key and foreign key). Once it had been adjusted to the right data type for each table, you can finally do
some subquery to find useful information.

## Usage
Using for extracting store details that contain api, s3 and pdf file for dataframe conversion and trying clean
the dataframe throughly for easier comparison. It can be used to create subquery from postgressql or VScode sqltools
to make further query and changing data type.
